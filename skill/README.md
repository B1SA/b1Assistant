The alexa skill b1Assistant.js has been moved from ./skill folder to ./skill/nodejs folder for sharing the same code between AWS Lambda function and stand alone alexa deloyment below.

Apart from deployment with AWS Lambda function,  Now you also can deploy the alexa skill locally or cloud foundry as standalone nodejs app. Follow the steps below:

### Step 1: Deploy the standalone b1Assistant locally or on a cloud platform with node run-time. 
  
   - To deploy on SAP Cloud Platform Cloud Foundry, run the command below:
```sh
$ cd ./skill/nodejs
$ cf push --random-route
$ cf set-env B1Assistant HDBHOST <YOUR HANA SERVER IP>
$ cf set-env B1Assistant HDBPORT <YOUR HANA SERVER PORT>
$ cf restart B1Assistant
```
 - To deploy locally, run the command below:
```sh
$ cd ./skill/nodejs
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
